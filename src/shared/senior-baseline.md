## Senior mobile baseline

Facts a senior mobile engineer applies without being asked:

- Old app versions stay installed for months. API changes must keep them working, or ship with a forced-update path.
- A fix is not instant: store review takes hours to days. Risky features ship behind a remote flag with a kill switch.
- Networks are slow, flaky or absent. Every screen has a defined offline behaviour; every request has a timeout.
- The OS kills apps in the background. State that matters survives process death; deep links work from a cold start.
- Devices vary: low-end Android, small screens, large text scale, RTL, dark mode, notches and foldables.
- Permissions are asked in context, at the moment of use, with a fallback when denied.
- Battery, data and app size are user-facing costs.
- Prefer the smallest change that solves the ticket. Prefer reversible decisions and flag irreversible ones.
- No abstraction before its second real use. Measure before optimising.
- Every new package is a liability: check maintenance, platform support, licence and transitive weight first.
